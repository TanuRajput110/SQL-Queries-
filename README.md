🔍 SQL Query Repository

Welcome to my SQL queries specialiszed for data analysis and database management tasks. From basic data retrieval to complex analytics, this repository covers queries how I used it to fetch detailed informative data of students.

🚀 Detail:-
I utilized Common Table Expressions (CTE) and various other important formulas and functions to extract data from the database. Here, I have retrieved data regarding attendance, inquiries, fees, class schedules, app access, and all necessary student details. Additionally, I have obtained details about the app, including its usage, the number of customers who logged into our app or attempted to purchase our courses, and those who have already made purchases, along with their locations.


Happy querying! 💻
